# Trap-Quest

If you use Gargoyle as an interpreter for the game, you can use the "Trap Quest Gargoyle AOB.CT" table.

If you use any other interpreter then Gargoyle, please use the "Trap Quest AOB.CT".

If you just want the Patreon unlocker for any interpreter, use the "Trap Quest AOB Patreon Only.CT" Table.

To make the Tables work, you have to do the following:

- Open the Trap Quest game file with your interpreter
- Once open, change the option "Automatic "press enter to continue"" to instant.
- Open the cheat engine table according to the above criteria
- Once the cheat engine table has loaded and is attached your game, activate the sript by clicking on the small black box next to "Activation"
- When it has succcesfully loaded and opened up more options to choose from, you can change the option "Automatic "press enter to continue"" in the game to something else you desire.

=======================

HOWTO for "Trap Quest Gargoyle AOB" character script

How to make this script work:
1: Start the game and choose "Normal Start"
2: Pick a FEMALE Character! THIS IS CRITICAL!
3: Press enter through the options, changing nothing.
4: Once you are in the actual game, activate the "Character Stats" script.
5: Now you can enter "restart" and either load your save or start however you want.

Things to remember:
- You have to do the steps each time you reload the game!
- If you deactivate the script and the "flesh volume" is not 3 anymore, the script WON'T work!
- If you load a save instead of a new female character, before activatiing the script, this will propably NOT work!
- This is a workaround, not a proper method. Do not expect it to work forever!

Help, I did the HowTo and the Pointers only shows weird numbers! / Script does not open!
1: Close the game.
2: Restart it and attach Cheat engine.
3: Follow the HowTo, but after step 3 do NOT activate the script!
4: In the game, do a few commands that don't change anything (wait, look, inv, x self )
5: Now activate the script.
